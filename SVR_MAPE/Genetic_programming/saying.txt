A genetic algorithm is a process in which a program evolve due to the combination of sensors and entities.

the variables represent the sensors
the functions the entities

each function changes to a same dimension space

in a sine(sin(x)) if we change the space sin(u), the u is transformed to a linear function

SVM passes from a quadratic equation in the primal to a quadratic in the dual.
