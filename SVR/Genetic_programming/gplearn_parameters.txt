init_depth: tuple, two integers. Range of initial depth (eg. init_depth = (2, 6))

population_size : the number of competitors on each generation

init_method : grow/full/half and half

	grow: nodes chosen at random and let to grow

	full: choosee nodes from the function set util the max depth is reached
 	
	half and half: 50% full and 50% grow
	
tournament_size: the size of individuals on each tournament for each generations


p_crossover: probability of donor-parent combination. It requires two tournaments to get the donor and the parent.
	donor: from which a subtree is selected
	parent: from which a subtree is substituted

p_subtree_mutation: probability of substituting on subree (random mutation).

p_hoist_mutation: probability of taking one subtree of each tournament winner and hoist it for the next generation

p_point_mutation: the probability of replacing random nodes from tournament winner. Terminals are replaced by terminals and functions by functions.
